My task was to create a forum that contains posts and comments. All of these should be retrieved from the following API endpoints:

Posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Comments: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

/ (home page)
1-The user should see all the posts - only print the title of the posts.
2-When clicking on the title of a post, the user should navigate to a new page with the URL / post /: id.

/ post /: id
1-Here the user should be able to see the title and text content of the post. Also print out all the comments made in this post. Each comment must contain its textual content, as well as the name and email of the person who commented.
2-There should also be a button to return to the list of all posts (home page).


/Technical requirements

1-A user should be able to navigate directly to a URL that contains an ID (eg / post / 9) and be able to see the post.
2-The page should be styled and give a "professional impression".
